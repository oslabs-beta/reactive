### Types of Good First Issues

At Reactive, we maintain several types of beginner-friendly issues:

#### TypeScript Migration Tasks
- Convert individual JavaScript/JSX files to TypeScript/TSX
- Perfect for learning TypeScript in a real project
- Clear guidelines and examples provided
- Focus on single, self-contained components

#### Documentation & User Experience
- Create usage examples for specific features
- Add demo GIFs of key workflows
- Develop clear, illustrative screenshots
- Each task comes with clear requirements and examples

### Getting Started with an Issue

1. **Find an Issue**
   - Look for issues labeled `good first issue` in our repository
   - Comment on the issue saying you'd like to work on it
   - We'll guide you through it!

2. **Make Changes**
   - Create a new branch following our naming convention:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/GH-123-brief-description
   ```
   Where:
   - `feature/` indicates it's a new feature
   - `GH-123` is the GitHub issue number
   - `brief-description` is 2-4 words describing the change
   
   For example:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/GH-45-convert-app-tsx
   git checkout -b feature/GH-52-add-usage-demo
   ```
   - Make your changes
   - Test them out
   - Follow the issue's specific guidelines

3. **Submit Your Work**
   - Push your changes
   - Create a Pull Request
   - We'll review it and provide feedback!

### Tips for Success
- Read the entire issue description before starting
- Ask questions if anything is unclear
- Keep changes focused on the issue scope
