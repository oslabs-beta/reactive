# React Visualizer VS Code Extension

## Overview

**React Visualizer** is a powerful VS Code extension designed to enhance the development experience for React applications. Developed as part of the OSLabs program, this tool provides a comprehensive visual representation of your React component structure, making it easier to understand and navigate React projects. This extension is especially useful for teams transitioning from class-based components to functional components, as well as from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Features

- **Component Tree Visualization**: Get a clear, hierarchical view of your React component structure.
- **Component Type Differentiation**: Easily distinguish between functional and class components.
- **Language Identification**: Quickly identify TypeScript and JavaScript components.
- **Full App Structure**: Visualize the entire structure of your React application.
- **State Inspection** *(Planned Feature)*: View and track component state in real-time.

### Stretch Goals

- **State Updates**: Inspect and monitor component state within the tree structure.
TODO ANIMATIONS  
-***Tip:*** Many popular extensions utilize animations to showcase their features. Consider adding short, focused animations demonstrating the component tree visualization.
