# React Visualizer VS Code Extension

## Overview

**Reactive** is a powerful VS Code extension designed to enhance the development experience for React applications. Developed as part of the OSLabs program, this tool provides a comprehensive visual representation of your React component structure, making it easier to understand and navigate React projects. 

## Product Description

Oftentimes as applications scale, it becomes increasingly challenging to keep track of the structure of an app. As a result, this extends the amount of time it takes for new developers to understand the application landscape and makes it impractical to keep track of code migration progress.   

Reactive aims to solve this problem by generating a visual representation of your app's component landscape within VS Code. This extension enables greater visibility into the architecture of the React app and is especially valuable for teams transitioning from class-based components to functional components, as well as from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Features

- **Component Tree Visualization**: Procure a clear, hierarchical view of your React component structure.
- **Component Type Differentiation**: Easily distinguish between functional and class components.
- **Language Identification**: Quickly identify TypeScript and JavaScript components.
- **Full App Structure**: Visualize the entire structure of your React application.
- **State Inspection**: Identify state variables across components. 

## Installation

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for "Reactive".
4. Click **Install**.

## Usage

1. Open a React project in VS Code.
2. Access the Reactive from the VS Code sidebar.
3. Click on components in the tree to collapse.
4. Click on State within component node to open State details
