# ==================================
# VSCODE EXTENSION IGNORE FILE
# ==================================

# IGNORED FILES/DIRECTORIES
# ------------------------
# Source files - ignored because we use compiled output
src/**                  # All TypeScript/JavaScript source files
                      # We use the compiled versions in 'out' directory

# Build and development files
dist/**                 # Development build output from webpack
node_modules/**         # NPM dependencies (will be installed by user)
.vscode/**             # VS Code editor settings
.vscode-test/**        # VS Code test environment files

# Config files - not needed in production
.gitignore             # Git ignore file
.yarnrc               # Yarn config
vsc-extension-quickstart.md  # VS Code extension guide
eslint.config.mjs      # ESLint configuration
webpack.config.js      # Development webpack config
webpack.prod.js        # Production webpack config
tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
**/tsconfig.json       # Any other TypeScript configs
**/*.map              # Source maps for debugging

# Test files - not needed in production
test/**               # Test directory
**/test/**           # Any test directories
**/*.test.js         # JavaScript test files
**/*.test.ts         # TypeScript test files

# System files
**/.DS_Store         # Mac OS system files
**/Thumbs.db         # Windows system files

# KEPT FILES (using ! to un-ignore)
# --------------------------------
!out/**              # KEEP: Production builds from webpack
                    # This is where our extension actually runs from

!images/Reactive.png # KEEP: Extension icon
                    # Required for VS Code marketplace

!package.json        # KEEP: Required for extension metadata and npm
                    # Contains extension configuration and dependencies

!README.md          # KEEP: Extension documentation
                    # Shows up on VS Code marketplace

!CHANGELOG.md       # KEEP: Version history
                    # Important for users to track changes

# Optional pattern for React components if sourcemaps needed
!src/webview/**/*.jsx  # KEEP: React components for sourcemap support
                     # Comment out if sourcemaps aren't needed

# ==================================
# How this works:
# 1. VS Code first ignores everything that matches ignore patterns
# 2. Then it un-ignores everything that matches patterns with !
# 3. Files must be explicitly un-ignored to be included
# 4. More specific patterns take precedence over less specific ones
